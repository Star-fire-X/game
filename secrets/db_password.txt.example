# Database Password Configuration Example
# ========================================
#
# This is an EXAMPLE file. Follow these steps to configure your database password:
#
# STEP 1: Copy this file
# ----------------------
# Copy this file to 'db_password.txt' in the same directory:
#
#   Linux/macOS:
#     cp secrets/db_password.txt.example secrets/db_password.txt
#
#   Windows (PowerShell):
#     Copy-Item secrets\db_password.txt.example secrets\db_password.txt
#
#   Windows (CMD):
#     copy secrets\db_password.txt.example secrets\db_password.txt
#
# STEP 2: Edit the password
# --------------------------
# Open secrets/db_password.txt and replace the example password below with your
# actual secure database password. The file should contain ONLY the password,
# no comments or extra lines.
#
# STEP 3: Set secure file permissions
# ------------------------------------
# Protect your password file from unauthorized access:
#
#   Linux/macOS:
#     chmod 600 secrets/db_password.txt
#     # This sets read/write for owner only
#
#   Windows (PowerShell - run as Administrator):
#     icacls secrets\db_password.txt /inheritance:r /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):F"
#     # This removes inheritance and grants full control to current user only
#
#   Windows (Alternative - File Properties):
#     1. Right-click secrets\db_password.txt → Properties → Security tab
#     2. Click "Advanced" → Disable inheritance → Remove all users
#     3. Add only your user account with Full Control
#
# STEP 4: Verify .gitignore
# -------------------------
# Ensure secrets/db_password.txt is listed in .gitignore to prevent
# accidentally committing your password to version control.
# The line should be: secrets/db_password.txt
#
# PASSWORD SECURITY GUIDELINES
# =============================
# Your database password should:
#   - Be at least 16 characters long
#   - Include uppercase and lowercase letters
#   - Include numbers and special characters
#   - NOT be reused from other services
#   - NOT contain dictionary words or personal information
#   - Be generated using a password manager if possible
#
# Example strong password format (DO NOT USE THIS EXACT PASSWORD):
#   Kp9$mN2#vR7@qL5!wX3^
#
# ========================================
# REMOVE ALL COMMENTS ABOVE THIS LINE IN YOUR ACTUAL db_password.txt FILE
# The actual file should contain ONLY the password, like this:
